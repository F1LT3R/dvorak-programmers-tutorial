Tao Te Ching - Chapter Three
By not adoring the worthy, people will not fall into dispute.
By not valuing the hard to get objects, people will not become robbers.
By not seeing the desires of lust, one's heart will not be confused.
Therefore the governing of the saint is to empty one's mind, substantiate one's virtue, weaken
one's worldly ambition and strengthen one's essence.
He lets the people to be innocent of worldly knowledge and desire, and keeps the clever ones
from making trouble with their wits.
Acts naturally without desire, then everything will be accomplished in its natural order.
