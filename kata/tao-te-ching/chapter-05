Tao Te Ching - Chapter Five
Nature nurtures all things with the wholeness of complete virtue.
It shows the greatest and perfect kindness by giving life to let all things grow and accomplish
them with the hastening of harvest.
Therefore, according to ancient custom, nature may seem unkind to regard all beings as a
traditional straw dog for sacrifice.
And likewise with a saint, he may seem unkind to regard people as a traditional straw dog for
sacrifice.
The space between heaven and earth is like the bellows, it appears empty yet it gives a supply
that never fails;
The more it moves, the more it brings forth.
Many words lead to exhaustion.
It is better to center on the true essence within.
