Tao Te Ching - Chapter Nine
Those who overly pride wealth is like the overflowing water which shall cause damages. It is
better to restrain early.
Those who are not content with fame is like polishing the edge of a knife.
The sharper it gets, the easier it is to break.
Wealth and treasures are but illusions that one cannot possess.
Those who are arrogant of their wealth and fame shall invite blame upon oneself.
The nature Tao teaches one to retreat after one's success and not to hold on to the credit.
