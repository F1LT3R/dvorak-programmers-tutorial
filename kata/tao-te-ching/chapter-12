Tao Te Ching - Chapter Twelve
The five colors can blind one's eyes.
The five tones can deafen one's ears.
The five flavors can dull one's taste buds.
The pursuit of pleasures can derange one's mind.
The hard-to-get valuables can distort one's behavior.
Therefore, a saint cultivates himself with virtues and does not indulge himself in sensory
pleasures.
He rejects those outer temptations and chooses this True Nature.
