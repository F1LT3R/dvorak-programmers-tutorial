Tao Te Ching - Chapter Thirteen
Honor and disgrace can surprise a person.
The greatest distress lies in one's physical body.
What does it men by "Honor and disgrace can surprise someone?"
Honor is inferior, because one who wins the favor is afraid of losing it.
And one who loses the favor is frightened with distress.
This is the significance of "Honor and disgrace can surprise someone."
What does it mean by "The greatest distress lies in one's body?"
We have fear because we worry about our physical self.
If one's body does not exist, how can one has fear?
Therefore, he who values the world as much as he values himself, can be entrusted with the
ruling of the world.
He who loves the world as much as he loves himself, can be entrusted with the guidance of the
world.
