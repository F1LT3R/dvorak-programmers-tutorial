Tao Te Ching - Chapter Sixteen
Human must achieve the ultimate void and maintain calmness with sincerity in order to observe
the growth and flourish of all beings.
It is in this way that one can understand the law of nature.
All things and beings will eventually return to the original source.
This is called "peace."
"Peace" means returning to one's original nature.
This original nature is the eternal law. To know the nature's law is to be enlightened.
He who is ignorant of the nature's law shall act recklessly, and thus will invite misfortune.
To know the constant law of nature is to be generous.
Being generous, one is impartial.
Being impartial, one is the sovereign.
Sovereign is the nature itself.
Nature is Tao. Tao is everlasting.
When one's physical body dies away, Tao still long endures.
