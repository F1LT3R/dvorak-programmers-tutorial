Tao Te Ching - Chapter Seventeen
In early ancient mankind, Tao has been in existence in one's true nature.
Men possess It without knowing.
One then acts with virtue and honor which is inferior to Tao.
The less superior is to act with fear.
And the least superior is to act with disgrace.
This occurs because one does not have enough faith, and hence has no confidence.
The nature of Tao is distinguished by wordless teaching with the natural act of virtue without
action.
As such, people would act effortlessly and harmonize with the Nature Tao.
