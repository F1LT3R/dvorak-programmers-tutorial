Tao Te Ching - Chapter Eighteen
When Great Tao declines, virtue of humanity and righteousness shall arise.
When knowledge and intelligence appear, great hypocrisy shall arise.
When the six various family relationships are not in harmony, filial piety and compassion shall
arise.
When a country is in chaos, the loyal officials shall appear.
