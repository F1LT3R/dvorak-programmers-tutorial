Tao Te Ching - Chapter Nineteen
Transcend the saint's teaching and conceal one's wisdom for potential use, shall benefit the
people a hundred fold.
Extend kindness to its ultimate and then polish to refine one's righteousness shall help the people
or regain filial piety and compassion.
Employ one's subtle true nature with exquisiteness and extend one's personal benefit to share
with others, shall eliminate robbers and thieves.
These three statements are apparent superficial and not sufficient to express the natural "Way" of
the great Tao.
Hence, this is what people should do:
 Return to their original true self and embrace the pure "Oneness."
 Refrain selfness and diminish worldly desires.
