Tao Te Ching - Chapter Twenty-Two
To yield is to preserve the whole.
To be misjudged is to be straightened.
To be hollow is to be filled.
To be battered is to be renewed.
To be in need is to possess.
To be abundant is to be confused.
Therefore, the saint embraces the "Oneness" as a standard for the world.
The wise one is not prejudiced, hence he is enlightened.
The wise one is not self-opinionated, hence he is outstanding.
The wise one does not boast of himself, hence he shall receive the credit.
The wise one does not praise his own deeds, hence can long endure.
Because the wise one does not conflict with others and therefore the world cannot contend
against him.
It is not true as the ancients say, "To yield is to preserve the whole?"
Thus the "Oneness" will be honored to him.
