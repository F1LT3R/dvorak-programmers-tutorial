Tao Te Ching - Chapter Twenty-Four
He who raises himself on tiptoe cannot stand firm.
He who walks with strides cannot travel far.
He who is self-opinionated shall not be enlightened.
He who is prejudiced shall not be recognized.
He who brags about himself shall not receive credit.
He who is arrogant shall not make improvements.
In view of Tao, people who are self-centered are like the surplus food and redundant actions in
everyday life.
All things disgust them.
Therefore a person of Tao will not conduct himself in such manner.
