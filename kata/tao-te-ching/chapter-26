Tao Te Ching - Chapter Twenty-Six
The heavy is the fundamental of the light. Tranquility is the master of agitation.
Therefore, the saint always conducts himself with the essence of Tao and never departs from It.
Although he is surrounded by the splendor of wealth, he remains to live a simple and ordinary

He who acts recklessly shall lose the essence of Tao.
He who is agitated with lust and desires shall lose his true nature.
