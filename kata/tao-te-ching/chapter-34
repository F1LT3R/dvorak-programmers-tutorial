Tao Te Ching - Chapter Thirty-Four
The great Tao is ever present.
It can adjust Itself to everything.
All things live by It, and It does not deny them.
When Its work is accomplished, It does not claim possession.
It gives great love to nurture all things and all lives, but dominates not.
The true void of Tao has no desires and may seem small.
Yet all things entrust their lives to It and It does not act as their master.
This may be recognized as "the Great."
Because a saint does not restrict himself with the greatness,
Hence his greatness is accomplished.
