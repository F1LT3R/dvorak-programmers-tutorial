Tao Te Ching - Chapter Forty-Two
Tao gives birth to one.
One gives birth to two.
Two gives birth to three.
Three gives birth to all things and all beings.
All beings bear the negative physical form which is represented by Ying, and embrace the
positive true nature which is represented by Yang.
With the union of these two, they arrive at a state of harmony.
Men dislike to be "the solitude," "the unworthy," and "the virtueless,"
Yet the Lords and nobles call themselves these names.
Hence, things are benefited by being humble, and damaged by profiting.
What the ancients had taught, I shall also teach as such:
A man of violence who is in disharmony between Ying and Yang that is the physical body and
true self, shall die of an unnatural death.
This is the essential of my teaching.
