Tao Te Ching - Chapter Fifty-Six
The wise does not speak.
He who speaks is not wise.
Keep silent and close one's mouth.
Keep guard on one's sensory organs.
Round off one's edges.
Untie the entangled.
Harmonize with the glory.
Mix with the lowliness.
This is called the Mystic Unity.
Because the wise is unified with all and has no distinction,
Thus, one cannot get close to him,
Nor can one keep far away from him,
One cannot benefit him,
Nor can one harm him,
One cannot honor him,
Nor can one disgrace him.
Therefore, he is honored by the whole world.
