Tao Te Ching - Chapter Fifty-Nine
In governing one's life and serving the nature,
There is nothing better than to follow the Way of simplicity.
Simplicity is to restrain one's desires.
To restrain one's desires is to practice the virtue of Nature Way.
By practicing the virtue of Nature Way,
One is capable to accomplish anything.
With the ability to accomplish anything,
One can achieve the infinite realm.
By achieving the infinite realm,
One can then become a true leader of a nation.
To govern a nation with the Law of Nature is to be long enduring.
This is regarded as a profound and firm foundation of the everlasting Tao.
