Tao Te Ching - Chapter Sixty-Two
Tao is the wonder of all creations.
It is a treasure for those who are kind.
It can also protect those who are not kind.
Words of Tao can benefit all people.
Its action can guide people to follow the right Way.
Those who have gone astray, the all-forgiving Tao will not abandon them.
Therefore, it is better to embrace this precious Tao than to be crowned as kings or appointed as
ministers or to possess wealth and fine horses.
So why did the ancients value and honor this Tao?
It is because "Those who seek will attain, those who offended will be forgiven."
Thus, It is the greatest honor in the world.
